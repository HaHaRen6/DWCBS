### Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)
The MAPF algorithm is used to find the shortest path between multiple agents without making any collision.

In this repo you can find the solution of the assignment given by (Sven Koenig)[] that is composed of 5 parts.
I've used the repository of (Zagoli Jacopo)[] that has already implemented the tasks 1 to 3 included.


### Task 4
The target of this taks is to implement the CBS (Conflict-Based Search) with Disjoint Splitting that means to
add the support of positive contraints to the CBS algorithm.
